radiowatch
----------

A small framework to periodically check radio stations and their currently played tracks.

> There is always this one song in the radio. 
> And only this one song!

Every one feels like this, but is this really true?

To back up this statement with data, I wrote this small framework
to crawl different radio stations and save the result.
